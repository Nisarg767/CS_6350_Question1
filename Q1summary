We are gonna do twitter sentiment analysis for different timestamp and it is showing that neutral tweets are higher than positive and negative sentiments over the time and graphical plot analysis is uploaded in plot pdf, The tweets related to the term “Covid19” are mostly neutral because it show people that see the threat but are also hopeful for better times to come as well as decreasing covid cases and negatives dominate other sentiments by a huge margin. This makes sense as there were lot of disturbing news and tweets about it during the times of covid. The Positive sentiment might represent tweets related to any help offered to an individual by an organization or some news about the vaccine, etc.
